    <h1>Welcome to my humble abode.</h1>
    <p>It appears you've stumbled upon my website. For that, I applaud you.</p>
    <p>For obvious reasons, I'm not applauding you for finding the website.
      Websites aren't hard to find, especially whatwith SEO and the fact that
      this site is spammed all over my social media accounts.
    </p>
    <p>Rather, I applaud you for deciding to be brave enough to click a random link
      that you found on the internet. You succeeded in scratching that itch in your
      brain - the itch that finally led you here.</p>
    <p>Just think about the implications of that for a moment, if you will.
      Countless millenia, untold wars, the rise and fall of many civilizations,
      the extinction of too many species to name - it all led you right here
      to this very moment, this very page on the web.
    </p>
    <p>Isn't that just remarkable?</p>
