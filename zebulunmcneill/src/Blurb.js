      <h2>greetings, traveller</h2>
      <p>It appears you've stumbled upon my website. For that, I applaud you.</p>
      <p>For obvious, I'm not applauding you for finding the website.
        Websites aren't hard to find, especially whatwith SEO and the
        fact that this site is spammed all over my social media accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather, I applaud you for deciding to be brave enough to
        click a random link that you found on the internet.
        You succeeded in scratching that itch in your brain -
         the itch that finally led you here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just think about the implications of that for a moment, if you will.
        Countless millenia, untold wars, the rise and fall of many civilizations,
        the extinction of too many species to name -
        it all led you right here to this very moment, this very
        page on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        Isn't that just remarkable?
      </p>
